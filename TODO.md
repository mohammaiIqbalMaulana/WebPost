# TODO: Modify print_export.ejs for Normal Mode

## Tasks
- [ ] Move the "Ringkasan Statistik" section above the chart section in normal mode
- [ ] Split the single combined chart into 6 separate charts (one for each metric: View, Like, Comment, Share, Save, ER)
- [ ] Update JavaScript to initialize 6 separate charts instead of one combined chart
- [ ] Ensure each chart is in its own card with appropriate styling
- [ ] Test the changes to verify correct rendering

## Notes
- Followers in summary remain unchanged as per user request
- Charts should be arranged in a responsive grid (e.g., 2 columns on medium screens)
- Maintain print-friendly styling for all charts
